# What is pres?

I got inspired as a summer researcher giving a research presentation in my college's Chemistry department after every previous presenter manually clicked from slide to slide on their computers. Physical clickers are expensive and most apps I found don't work well, so I created pres (pronounced "press"), which is a PowerPoint presentation controller built with TouchOSC and Max. It was written entirely in Max 7 and relies on the <a href="http://www.iamas.ac.jp/~aka/max/#aka_keyboard">aka.keyboard</a> object by Mayasuki Akamatsu, as well as <a href="http://hexler.net/software/touchosc">TouchOSC</a> (Â© Hexler Limited).

# Getting Started

## Introduction

If you're new to GitHub, welcome! You can download the entire repository as a .zip file by clicking "Clone or download" button over on the right there. Make sure that the "Branch" listed on the left says "master".

If you want to open and edit the Max patch itself, you'll need to download the aka.keyboard object, which you can find at the link above. You'll also need to download Max 7, if you haven't already.

If you just want to use the program, either open the .mxf files in Max or download the .app. Windows .exe files are currently not supported :(
