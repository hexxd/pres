# What is pres?
I got inspired as a summer researcher giving a research presentation in my college's Chemistry department after every previous presenter manually clicked from slide to slide on their computers. Physical clickers are expensive and most apps I found don't work well, so I created pres (pronounced "press"), which is a PowerPoint presentation controller built with TouchOSC and Max. It was written entirely in Max 7 and relies on the <a href="http://www.iamas.ac.jp/~aka/max/#aka_keyboard">aka.keyboard</a> object by Mayasuki Akamatsu.
